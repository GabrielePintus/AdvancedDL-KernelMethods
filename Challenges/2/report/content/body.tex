\section{Conclusions}
In this report, we explored the double descent phenomenon observed
when training neural networks with varying numbers of parameters.
Additionally, we showed that neural networks can more effectively
approximate target functions that possess a hierarchical and
compositional structure. This highlight the significance of the
target function's structure in influencing the network's performance.
