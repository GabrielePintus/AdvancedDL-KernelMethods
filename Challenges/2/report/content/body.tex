\section{Conclusions}
In this report we have seen how Kernel PCA can be used to reduce the
dimensionality of the data and how it can outperform PCA when the data
lies in a non-linear manifold.
We have also seen how unsupervised learning can be used to retrieve
labels from the data and how these labels can be used to train classifiers.
Finally, we have seen how the performance of the classifiers can improve
when trained on the original labels.
