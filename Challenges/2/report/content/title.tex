\begin{abstract}
    In this notebook we  investigates the learnability of functions by neural
    networks through empirical analysis in two distinct steps.  The first explores
    the effects of under and over parameterization in a teacher-student setup, where
    student networks learn from input-output pairs generated by a frozen teacher network.
    The second challenge examines the ability of deep residual networks to learn
    hierarchical versus non-hierarchical polynomial functions. the sixth-order
    multivariate complete Bell polynomial $B_6$ is compared to a scrambled counterpart $\tilde{B}_6$.
    All the code is written in Python and it can be found in the GitHub repository at the following
