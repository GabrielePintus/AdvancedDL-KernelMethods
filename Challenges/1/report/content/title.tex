\begin{abstract}
    In this notebook we explore the efficacy of kernel methods in treating
    data before solving both unsupervised and supervised tasks. We work on
    the \textbf{Fashion MNIST} dataset which contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale
    images of fashion products from 10 categories from a dataset of Zalando
    article images, with 7,000 images per category. All the code is written
    in Python and it can be found in the GitHub repository at the following
